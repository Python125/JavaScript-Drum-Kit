## Drum Kit Project: Building a Virtual Instrument
![Screenshot](/images/webpage-screenshot.png)

This project replicates a drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the "JavaScript30" course by Wes Bos.

### To build it yourself:
1. Create an account at https://wesbos.com/courses.
2. Search for "JavaScript30" and find the drum kit project.
3. Follow along with the video tutorial.

### My Enhancements:
While the original project offered a basic keyboard interaction, I've made some modifications to create a more immersive experience:

- **Visual Drum Kit:** I replaced the background with a drum kit image from a drummer's perspective, making it feel like you're sitting behind the kit yourself.

- **Interactive Keys:** Instead of a simple color change, the key boxes now "pop up" and change color when pressed. I've also adjusted the border thickness, radius, and added individual box shadows for a more polished look.

- **Backing Tracks:** To enhance the experience, I integrated two drum-less tracks, allowing users to play along. The titles and artists are displayed clearly to the right of each audio tag for easy identification.
