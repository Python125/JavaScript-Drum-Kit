This project is a hands-on exploration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inspired by Wes Bos' "JavaScript30" course. Building upon the foundation of the drum kit challenge, I've enhanced the original project by making significant modifications to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The goal was to create a more immersive and engaging drumming experience.

## Drum Kit Project: Building a Virtual Instrument

### To build it yourself:
1. Create an account at https://wesbos.com/courses.
2. Search for "JavaScript30" and find the drum kit project.
3. Follow along with the video tutorial.

### My Enhancements:
My enhancements focus on creating a virtual drumming experience that feels more realistic and engaging. Here's a breakdown of the additions I made:

- **Visual Drum Kit:** I swapped the background for a drum kit image seen from a drummer's perspective, placing you right in the heart of the action.

- **Interactive Keys:** Hitting a key no longer just changes color; it "pops up" for a more dynamic effect. Additionally, I adjusted borders, rounded corners, and added individual box shadows for a polished look.

- **Backing Tracks:** To jam along with, I integrated two drum-less tracks. Titles and artists are displayed clearly next to each audio tag for easy identification.
